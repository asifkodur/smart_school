      <h2> How to</h2>
      <p> Most of the menues and options are self explanatory and intutive. However, here is the step by step
      manual for making things clearer and easier for you</p>
      
      
      <h3 id="view_type"> Login</h3>
      
      The software is password protected in order to safeguard important data and avoid misuse.
      Two inbuilt users are available for login
      <ol><li>admin</li>
      <li>teacher</li>
      
      </ol>
      <p>
      Admin user is the most privilleged user who can make potential changes to the data and settings.
      So, it is advised to limit the access to this account to one or two users who can judiciously manage
      the software without causing data loss.</p>
      
      <p>In order to enter exam score, generate progress report, promtion list etc, you only require the previllege of
      a 'teacher' user. However,only the admin user has the necessary previllege to manage divisions, edit students' details, etc, 
      
      
      </p>
      <p>default passwords 
      <ul>
      <li>admin:-<i>admin</i></li>
      <li>teacher:-<i>teacher</i></li>
      </ul>
        <h3 id="animation_style"> Institution Settings</h3>
      <p>Once successfully logged in as admin, the Admin Dash Board gets open from which "Institutio"
      button can be selected. Fill the text boxes and click Save Button </p>
      <h3 id="bars_text"> Academic Year and Division</h3>
      
      <p> Select "Year and Division"" from Admin Dash, divisions for any academic year can be added or removed using this window.
      To add divisions from A-k, just type A-K in the division text box instead of adding one by one manually
      </p>
      <p>The link 'Add Next Academic Year' automatically creates next academic year.</p>
      
      <h3 id="vote_counter"> Set CE and TE</h3>
      Before entering examination scores, you have to set the CE and TE marks for each standards for the particular academic year.
      Use CE TE Settings option for this 
      <h3 id="rating_icons"> Working Days</h3>
      Total workigs days for three terms is required for processing promotion list and progress report of that term. 
      Working Days button in the Dash borsd will help do it.
      <h3 id="rating_titles"> Add, Edit or Remove Students</h3>
      <p>
      The software comes with a very powerful tool that helps add the details of all students in the school in a single click.
      Import from Sampoorna feature is a fast, reliable and safe way to add all students data to <i>Smart School </i>Software.
      As the software does not make any changes to the database of Sampoorna and does not save the user name or password it is completely safe.
      It is definitely a great idea to use this to initialize the database. Afte importing, you may have to edit the roll numbers once, which can easily be done by logging in as teacher user.
      In subsequent years, it might be better to import the data of 8th standard only after promoting other students using 'promote' option</p>
      
      <p>Manage Students tool is meant for adding, editing, removing individual students details. It is available in Admin Dash
      </p>
      <h3 id="bar_colors"> Backup Data</h3>
      <p> It is always a good idea to backup vital data on machine. 'Export Database' tool is designed for that. It generates a file with .xam extension. If you encounter any data loss this backed-up file can be imported using 'Import Database', which restores the data.
    
    <h2>Reports</h2>
    
    	<h3 id="progress_report">Progress Report</h3>
    	<p>Progress report of individual classes can be had by logging in as 'teacher'. Select Performance Card from Reports Menu on the top of the window.
    	</p>     
    	
    	<h3 id="promotion_list"	>Promotion List</h3>
    	<p>Promotion list can also be generated using the Report menu option found in the individual classes when logged in as 'teacher'
    	The promotions lists of multiple classes may be made using Promotion List tool in Admin Dash
    	
    	<h3 id="custom_report">Custom Report</h3>
    	<p>Custom report is designed keeping in mind the need for academic scores of students in schools for various purpose.
    	This feature enables you to create reports of one or more classes with columns and data of your choice. Like Name, CE of One Subject, TE of the Subject, Total Mark, Grade, etc. The result is given in the form of spreadsheet file so that it can be used for editing and modificatios
    </p>
    <h3 id="sampoorna_import">Sampoorna Import</h3>
    <p>
    The software comes with a very powerful tool that helps add the details of all students in the school in a single click. Import from Sampoorna feature is a fast, reliable and safe way to add all students data to Smart School Software. 
    As the software does not make any changes to the database of Sampoorna and does not save the user name or password it is completely safe.
     It is definitely a great idea to use this to initialize the database. Afte importing, you may have to edit the roll numbers once, which can easily be done by logging in as teacher user. 
     In subsequent years, it might be better to import the data of 8th standard only after promoting other students using 'promote' option
    </p>
    <h3 id="data_import">Data Import</h3>There is a feature made available for performing data sync and transport across computers.
    In a school, it is not possible to install the software on a single computer and do the work on it always. This feature allows us to work on different computers and keep our work safe. A teacher can enter the mark of a class pertially in one computer and the other part in another machine. 
    In such cases, this tool is helpful in syncing the data. In order to sync data
    Export Database first and take the backup file ___.xam in a storage device. Login as admin in the targer computer and import the backup file using "Import Database". Importing will not affect normally the other classes or data already saved in the target machine. However,it is safer to back the database of the targer computer also before import.
